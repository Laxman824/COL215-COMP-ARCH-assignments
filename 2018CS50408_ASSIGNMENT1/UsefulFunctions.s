@ prints: Output a null-terminated ASCII string to the standard output stream

@    r0: the address of a null-terminated ASCII string
@ Result:
@    None, but the string is written to standard output (the console)

@ fprints: Output a null-terminated ASCII string to a selected stream
@          (a text file opened for output or stdout or stderr)
@
@ Usage:
@    fprints(r0, r1)
@ Input parameters:
@    r0: a file handle
@    r1: the address of a null-terminated ASCII string
@ Result:
@    None, but the string is written to the specified stream

@ fgets: read an ASCII text line from an input stream (a text file
@        opened for input or standard input)
@
@ Usage:
@    r0 = fgets(r0, r1, r2)
@ Input parameters:
@    r0: the address of a buffer to receive the input line
@    r1: the size of the buffer (which needs to accommodate a
@        terminating null byte)
@    r2: the handle for a text file opened for input or 0 if input
@        should be read from stdin
@ Result:
@    r0: the address of the buffer if some characters were read,
@        or 0 if no characters were read due to EOF or error.
@        One text line including a terminating linefeed character
@        is read into the buffer, if the buffer is large enough.
@        Otherwise the buffer holds size-1 characters and a null byte.
@        Note: the line stored in the buffer will have only a linefeed
@        (\n) line ending, even if the input source has a DOS line
@        ending (a \r\n pair).
